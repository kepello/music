Fingers falling like raindrops on the keys
Cursor blinking, judging me
Eyes half-closed, drifting off the breeze
Then I start to see
The letter D, the D key
“dee” “dee” “dee” — yeah, the nod-off disease


The screen’s a sea of letters glowing white
Every thought compiles into the night
Each “dee” a footprint left behind
From a drifting architect’s mind

[Chorus]
Oh “dee”
Oh “dee”
I’m stuck in the key of D
Night runs long
Logic hits the wall with me
Oh “dee”
That after-midnight plea


The clock’s a liar selling borrowed time
Says, “One more fix, you’ll be fine”
But “dee” keeps tally, never lies
Marks the moment my focus dies

Home row humming like a tired refrain
Syntax softening in my brain
Every “dee” a quiet sign
I crossed the edge of compile time

[Chorus]
Oh “dee”
Oh “dee”
I’m stuck in the key of D
Night runs long
Logic hits the wall with me
Oh “dee”
That after-midnight plea

Somewhere between the code and melody
I’m working in the key of D
Not major, minor — just barely awake
One hand on the board, one foot on the brake
It’s a lullaby in monospace
A soft breakpoint in time and space
It’s my alibi
For why


“dee” “dee” “dee” — a quiet alert
From the edge of consciousness
“dee” “dee” “dee” —
You should probably get some rest

[Final Chorus]
Oh “dee”
Oh “dee”
Keyboard key, melody
Same old loop
Different kind of harmony
Oh “dee”
Late-night clarity


So I’ll save my work and let it be
One last “dee” staring back at me
Morning light will ship the fix
But tonight belongs to “dee”
