### D
*The Key of D*

This song came from a small, slightly ridiculous moment.

Late one evening, I nodded off while working on my laptop. When I startled awake, there was a long string of the letter D on the screen—my fingers, resting on the home row, had apparently kept typing while I slept. For whatever reason, the D key took the hit.

The next evening, the exact same thing happened.

That repetition felt odd, amusing, and just strange enough to stick with me. Why the letter D? What made it even funnier was the realization that “the D key” doesn’t just belong to a keyboard—it also happens to be the Key of D in music. That small overlap between muscle memory and musical instinct made the whole moment feel strangely appropriate.

So I leaned into the curiosity and the humor and wrote a song from it. No hidden meaning, no deeper message—just a lighthearted response to an accidental pattern and a grin-worthy connection. Not everything needs to be profound.

Sometimes a song exists simply because something made you smile.
