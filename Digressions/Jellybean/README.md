*The Last Jellybean*

I didn’t really write this song.

The lyrics and topic were generated by artificial intelligence—chosen at random, playful to the point of absurdity. On the surface, it’s just a silly song about a runaway jellybean. And that’s exactly what it’s meant to be.

But this track belongs in this collection for a different reason.

This was the moment when I first connected the dots and truly understood what AI could do with music. Hearing a complete set of lyrics appear—structured, rhythmic, and oddly coherent—was eye-opening. More importantly, I realized that while the words weren’t mine, the choices still were. I could shape the arrangement, adjust the pacing, exaggerate the groove, and lean into the humor until the music landed exactly the way it needed to.

As I played with the arrangement, it started to make me laugh in the way the lyrics seemed to ask for. That was the pivot. The realization that AI could generate a spark, but I could mold it, bend it, and steer it toward expression—even when the expression was just playful nonsense.

This song marks the beginning of a new creative process for me. Not replacement. Collaboration. A new instrument, rather than an author.

So yes, it’s ridiculous.
But it opened a door.

And once that door opened, everything that came after was possible.
