Spread-sheet open on the stand 
Color-coded practice plan
30 minutes, column three, 
Cell D says fun, still empty

Fretting fingers, fretting mind, 
Index lost on fret six through nine
Relax your hand, the teacher grins
I log that note, attempt again

I've got that, left-brain beginner blues
Overthinking every chord I choose
Measuring progress in neat reviews,
But my strum keeps choking on the two's
yeah, I've got that, left brain beginner blues

Thumb at 90, wrist at 10
I graph my pain restart again
Metronome ticks, I chase the light
Still arrive, one beat too tight
Barre chord buzz like neon sign
Error, Error, out of line

I make a chart of all my flubs
Should probably just, you know, 
Play stuff

What if I'm miss, what if I slide, 
What if I just enjoy the ride?

Close the app, uncheck the box, 
Just four bare colds, let them rock, 

That's enough, that's enough
That's enough

What if I'm miss, what if I slide,
What if I just enjoy the ride?

What if I'm miss, what if I slide, 
what if I just enjoy the ride?
