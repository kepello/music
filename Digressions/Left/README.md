*Left-Brained Beginner Blues*

This song was written out of a very real—and very familiar—frustration.

For most of my life, I’ve leaned hard into the analytical side of my brain. Planning, structure, systems, measuring progress—those are places where I’ve been comfortable and confident. Guitar, it turns out, asks for something different.

I’m taking lessons from an excellent teacher who also happens to be a friend. He models relaxation, feel, and listening—qualities that don’t neatly fit into spreadsheets or color-coded plans. I want to improve, so my instinct is to track everything: time spent, techniques attempted, mistakes made. Along the way, “practice” can crowd out “play.”

This song lives in that tension. It’s about the habit of overthinking, of turning music into metrics, and the quiet resistance that comes from the instrument itself. Fingers buzz. Timing slips. Progress refuses to be graphed. And underneath all of it is a simple question that keeps resurfacing: What if I stop measuring and just enjoy the sound coming out of the guitar?

The song doesn’t resolve the struggle—it just names it. Writing it helped me see that learning guitar isn’t only about developing skill, but about learning to loosen my grip, silence the running commentary, and trust something less orderly and more human.

Sometimes the hardest part of learning isn’t technique.
It’s permission.
