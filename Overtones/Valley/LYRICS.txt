Still shadows ahead
Still strength in my bones
Still in the valley
But never on my own

The shadow stretches, the dark holds on
But the promise does not depart
I have walked this way before
I have learned the Shepherd’s heart

Between the mountains, the valley waits
Five stones in my pouch, ready to rise
He laughs from his height of hardened steel
Calls out for a fighting man

I was sent for bread, not for a blade
Not numbered among the strong
I learned the quiet of open fields
Where fear and faith stand strong

The battle line was drawn in fear
Not earth beneath our feet
He thundered from his height of steel
Daring one man to speak.

Though I stand in the valley of death
I won’t leave room for fear
You’re with me in shadow and dark
Your word draws me near
I let his words ring hollow
I won’t trust the sword or shield
I stand in the valley of death
And I know who walks this field

Years pass heavy, the throne grows cold
The night finds a man alone
I write by lamp, I answer in song
Of a road that I’ve known

The valley wears a different face
No shouting now, no steel
But the same hand that steadied my aim
Now teaches my heart to be still

The shadow stretches, the air hangs low
And the old voice calls my name
“Give me a man, and let us fight it out!””
But the promise still remains

Though I walk in the valley of death
I won’t leave room for fear
You’re with me in shadow and dark
Your word draws me near
Your rod has guided every step
Your staff has held me still
I walk through the valley of death
And my soul is standing still

Before the stone cut through the air
Before the giant fell
You were already in the valley
I was never alone - in EE-luh

So I walk through the valley of death
Head lifted, heart awake
Goodness follows all my days
Mercy never waits
If this road runs through darkness
And it still is Your will
I walk through the valley of death
And I will fear no EE-ville

Still darkness ahead
Still strength in my bones
Still in the valley
But never on my own
