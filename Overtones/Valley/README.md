“The Philistines occupied the mountain on one side, and the Israelites occupied the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them.”
— 1 Samuel 17:3

When I read the account of David and Goliath, what caught my attention wasn’t just the giant—it was the valley.

Both armies held the high ground. Neither wanted to step down into that open place of vulnerability. Goliath’s challenge wasn’t only about strength; it was an invitation to leave safety and face fear head-on. No one answered—until David arrived, not as a warrior, but carrying bread.

David had already learned faith in quieter places: alone in the fields, facing danger without an audience. If he felt fear in the valley, it didn’t stop him from entering it. He trusted the God who had walked with him before.

What I had never noticed before was how this moment echoes Psalm 23. Years later, David would write about walking through “the valley of deep shadow” without fear. I can’t help but wonder if this was one of the valleys he had in mind—looking back on his youth and recognizing that Jehovah had been with him in every frightening place, every narrow pass, every moment of weakness.

This song moves between that first valley and later seasons of David’s life—when the battles were no longer public or loud, but internal and lonely. The setting changes, but the truth remains the same: he was never alone in the valley.

Valley is about walking into places of weakness without losing faith—about realizing that long before the stone flew, we were never alone.
