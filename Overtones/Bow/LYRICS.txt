Neb-you-kad-nezzar made an image
Sixty cubits high
Herald cried it loud
So every soul replied
“Bow when you hear it
Every drum and horn”
Fall before the gold
Or face the burning flame

Shadrack, Meshack, Abed-nee-go
Answered the king that day:
“The God that we serve
Is able to save
Able to make a way”

But even if He does not
Let it be known, O king
We will not bow to your gods
Or worship that golden thing

The king burned with anger
His temper flamed
“Heat that furnace hotter”
Seven times the same
Faith in their hearts
As they stepped toward the fire

The fire roared louder
Than the crowd that day
The soldiers who led them
Were swept away
But the three Hebrews stood
Though the heat came fast
Trusting their God
Through the flame’s blast

The king rose shaking
His voice grew thin
“Did we not throw three
Bound men in?”

“Look! I see four men walking
In the middle of the flame
Unbound, unharmed
Calling on Gods name

Shadrack, Meshack, Abed-nee-go
had answered the king 
“The God that we serve
Is able to save
Able to make a way”

But even if He does not
Let it be known, O king
We will not serve your gods
Or worship any 'THING'

The king called them out
To the furnace door
“Servants of the Most High God
Come out once more”
Not a hair was burned
No smoke remained

Blessed be the God
Who rescued His own
They trusted in Him
They did not stand alone
They chose to die
Before they’d bend
Faith in their God
Until the end

But even if He does not

We will not bow
Even if He does not
We will not bow
