_1 Corinthians 13:1–8_

I've never thought of Paul as a poet or lyricist in the way I think of David. But as I've spent more time with these verses, I'm starting to notice beauty not only in their content, but in their form as well—though I'm far from an expert in this.

Paul places himself in the first person—not to accuse or confess himself or us, but to reason. He first imagines the highest forms of human goodness—eloquence, insight, sacrifice, faith—and then gently empties them of weight when love is absent. Even the most impressive gifts are revealed as sound without substance: nothing more than empty noise.

Beginning in verse 4, he turns from hypotheticals and simply names what love is. The language becomes plain and simple, avoiding metaphor and self-reference. Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not exalt itself or delight in what is false. It bears, believes, hopes, and endures—not heroically, but steadily. Love is now allowed to stand firm in simplicity and contrast.

The song ends without crescendo or release. It doesn’t rise—it settles.
