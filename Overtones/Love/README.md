# Love

_1 Corinthians 13:1–8_

I have never thought of Paul as a poet or lyricist in the way we think of David. Yet when I shift my perspective back just slightly, I begin to see great beauty not only in the content of these verses, but in their form as well.

Paul places himself in the first person—not to accuse or confess himself or us, but to reason. He first imagines the highest forms of human goodness—eloquence, insight, sacrifice, faith—and then gently empties them of weight when love is absent. Even the most impressive gifts are revealed as sound without substance: nothing more than empty noise.

Beginning in verse 4, he turns from hypotheticals and simply names what love is. The language becomes plain and simple, avoiding metaphor and self-reference. Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not exalt itself or delight in what is false. It bears, believes, hopes, and endures—not heroically, but steadily. Love is now allowed to stand firm in simplicity and contrast.

The song ends without crescendo or release. It doesn’t rise—it settles.
