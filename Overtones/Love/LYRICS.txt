[Verse 1]
If I spoke the tongues of angels
Every language, every sound
If my voice could reach the heavens
But love was not around

Grant a generous assumption
Suppose I had it all
Nothing more than empty noise
I would matter not at all

[Verse 2]
If I knew the hidden future
Every secret, every sign
If I held the truth in my hands
Every reason, every why

If my faith could move the mountains
Shift the ground beneath my feet
Without love I would stand empty
Nothing solid underneath

[Verse 3]
If I gave away my riches
If I laid my body down
Even everything I offered
No meaning would be found

Without love it comes to nothing
No reward, no lasting gain
Every cost returns to silence
Every sacrifice in vain

[Verse 4]
Love is patient
Love is kind
It does not envy
Is not self-inclined

It does not keep
A record of wrongs
It does not delight
In what's not right

[Verse 5]
It bears all things
Believes again
It hopes beyond
What strength can lend
It stays the course
It stands through trials
It endures until the end

[Bridge]
This is where love stands firm
This is what remains

[Outro]
Love never fails
