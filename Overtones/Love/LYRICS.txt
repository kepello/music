If I spoke the tongues of angels
Every language, every sound
If my voice could reach the heavens
But love was not around

Grant a generous assumption
Suppose I had it all
Nothing more than empty noise
I would matter not at all

If I knew the hidden future
Every secret, every sign
If I held the truth in my hands
Every reason, every why

If my faith could move the mountains
Shift the ground beneath my feet
Without love I would stand empty
Nothing solid underneath

If I gave away my riches
If I laid my body down
Even everything I offered
No meaning would be found

Without love it comes to nothing
No reward, no lasting gain
Every cost returns to silence
Every sacrifice in vain

Love is patient
Love is kind
It does not envy
Is not self-inclined

It does not keep
A record of wrongs
It does not delight
In what's not right

It bears all things
Believes again
It hopes beyond
What strength can lend
It stays the course
It stands through trials
It endures until the end

This is where love stands firm
This is what remains

Love never fails
