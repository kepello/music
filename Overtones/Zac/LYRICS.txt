Crowd packed tight on a dusty street
Everybody swaying just to catch a peek
Something good going on today
But Zacchaeus couldn’t see a single thing that way

He hopped left, he hopped right
Still lost in a sea of robes and sandals tight
Said “Nah man, I’m not done yet”
Saw a tree and made a quick ascent

Little legs, big old grin
“Best seat in Jericho, I’m settling in”
Leaves shaking, branch bending free
Still laughing like, “Hey — I can see!”

zak in the tree, rocking back and forth
Didn’t come for the shade, came chasing something more
zak in the tree, mind wide open
Didn’t know love was already spoken
zak in the tree — hey hey
Turns out  faith can climb that way

Jesus stopped, looked up slow
Called him by name like “I know you, bro”
"Zacchaeus, come down, don’t waste no time
Today I’m stepping into your life”

Crowd went “Hmm,” crowd went “Nah”
“That’s the tax man, look who you are”
But Zacchaeus hit the ground with a brand new pace
Like the sun just punched him in the face

Books and numbers, coins and fears
Fell real quiet when love got near
Truth stood up, heart stood tall
Didn’t feel small anymore at all

zak in the tree, climbing out of shame
Funny how mercy always knows your name
zak in the tree — upside surprise
Found himself when he changed his mind
zak in the tree — hey hey
Love came looking that day

Half to the poor, let it flow
Four times back, yeah everybody know
More than the law, more than fair
That’s what happens when you stop pretending you don’t care

You can’t outrun it
Can’t out-climb it
Love's got legs, man
And perfect timing

Where was Zacchaeus?
Up in the tree!
What he looking for?
He didn’t even know — but mercy!

zak in the tree, lost then found
Joy came laughing to the ground
Son of Abraham, welcome home
Turns out nobody walks alone
zak in the tree — hey hey
That’s how love works its way

Yeah…
Sometimes faith don’t look so neat
Sometimes it climbs up fig-mulberry trees
If you wanna see what  faith can be
Might have to move… and climb a little free
