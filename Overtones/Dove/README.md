_If Only I Had Wings Like a Dove_

This song draws its words from one of the Psalms that has stayed closest to me—Psalm 55.

In it, David is not calm or composed. He is distressed, pressed, and overwhelmed. He gives voice to a longing that feels instantly familiar: the desire to be like a bird and simply fly away from what is hurting him. Not to fix it. Not to confront it. Just to escape it.

These verses resonate with me deeply.

David cried out to God, and Jehovah saved him—but that salvation didn't spare him from the emotions of the moment. The fear, the turmoil, the weight of betrayal and danger were still real. I notice that scripture doesn't sanitize that—it preserves David's humanity in full view, and that honesty is what gives his words their power, at least for me.

David’s life was complicated. He made large, public mistakes, and the emotional cost of those choices followed him. Yet he continued to write, to pray, to trust, and to endure. He teaches us how to live through moments when escape isn’t possible—when you can’t fly away—by turning to God for refuge, safety, and concealment.

There is a tension here that feels very real: God can—and does—save us. And yet we may still struggle deeply within the reality we're standing in. In my experience, faith doesn't erase that struggle—it gives us somewhere to bring it.

These verses are poetic, raw, and unresolved in the best possible way. They remind us that scripture is not distant or theoretical—it is lived, felt, and painfully honest. And because of that, it becomes practical. It becomes relatable. It becomes something we can lean on when we feel overwhelmed ourselves.

Sometimes endurance isn’t about strength.
It’s about knowing where to turn when you can’t fly away.
