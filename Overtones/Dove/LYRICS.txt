If only I had wings like a dove

My heart is in anguish within me,
And the terrors of death overwhelm me.
Fear and trembling come upon me,
And shuddering grips me.

I keep saying: “If only I had wings like a dove!
I would fly away and reside in safety.

Look! I would flee far away.
I would lodge in the wilderness.
I would hurry to a place of shelter
Away from the raging wind, away from the storm.”

I keep saying: “If only I had wings like a dove!
I would fly away and reside in safety.

I keep saying: “If only I had wings like a dove!
I would fly away and reside in safety.

As for me, I will call out to God,
And Jehovah will save me.
Evening and morning and noontime, I am troubled and I groan,
And he hears my voice.

I keep saying: “If only I had wings like a dove!
I would fly away and reside in safety.
