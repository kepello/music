On a hill where the daylight waned,
Hope was barely drawing breath;
A quiet plea through suffering sustained,
Please remember me beyond my death.

No throne revealed to mortal eyes,
No royal robe on proud display;
Yet every word began to rise,
A kingdom spoken on its way.

Today this promise lives
Though hope waits just beyond our sight
What God has sworn — He gives
And all that’s broken will be right

Hold fast the guarantee
The promise stands —
For each our lives
You WILL — be with Me
In paradise

Just a little while — the proud are gone for good
Their footprints fade from view
You search the ground where they once stood
And find the earth made new

The humble stand with heads held high
The weight of fear begins to cease
They inherit more than soil and sky
They inherit rest and peace

Today this promise lives
Though hope waits just beyond our sight
What God has sworn — He gives
And all that’s broken will be right

Hold fast the guarantee
The promise stands —
For each our lives
You WILL — be with Me
In paradise

The meek will possess the land,
Knowing a joy beyond belief;
They will inherit what God has planned,
And live in abundant peace.

Today this promise lives
Though hope waits just beyond our sight
What God has sworn — He gives
And all that’s broken will be right

Hold fast the guarantee
The promise stands —
For each our lives
We WILL — be with You
In paradise

Just a little while, we wait,
The promise firm and sure;
What lies ahead will not come late,
His promise will forever endure.
