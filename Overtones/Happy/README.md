_Happy Is The One Who Reads it Aloud_

Most people don’t think of the Bible book of Revelation as a message of happiness. Yet that’s exactly how it begins—with a promise that those who read it, who hold on to it, and who live by it will be happy. That promise has always stood out to me.

Revelation doesn’t ignore suffering or minimize it. Instead, it looks straight through it—past fear, past loss, past grief—and points prophetically to a future we long for. Some of the most encouraging words in all of scripture are found there.

Among them are Revelation 21:3, 4.

Few promises are more deeply comforting: an end to pain, an end to death, and the assurance that the things which have wounded us will fade, no longer recalled, no longer shaping our days. It’s not just relief—it’s restoration. The idea of a future where suffering doesn’t merely stop, but loses its grip on memory, has always filled me with hope.

I challenged myself with this song to focus on happiness. Not shallow cheerfulness, but genuine joy rooted in promise. I wanted the music itself to feel good—to move, to groove, to invite a smile. This one makes my toe tap. It lifts my mood every time I play it.

Those verses have always made me happy. But somehow, setting them against a rhythmic pulse—yes, even imagining slap bass—transformed them into something fresh and alive for me. The message didn’t change. My experience of it did.

This song did what I hoped it would: it made me smile.
