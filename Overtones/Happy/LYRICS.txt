Happy is the one who reads it aloud
Happy the ones who hear
Who hold on to the words that are written
Knowing the time is near

I heard a voice from the throne say,
“Look now — God is here.
He will dwell among mankind,
He will stay, He will draw near.
They will be His people now,
And He Himself will be there.”

He will wipe every tear from their eyes,
Death will be gone.
No more mourning, no more crying,
No more pain hanging on.
All the former things have faded,
They are past, they are gone.

Happy is the one who reads it aloud
Happy the ones who hear
Who hold on to the words that are written
Knowing the time is near

The one on the throne said softly,
“Look now — I make things new.
Write it down so you remember,
These words are faithful, true.
What I’ve spoken will not fade,
Let it carry you through.

Be happy as you read it aloud,
Be happy as you hear.
Hold on to the words that are written,
You know the time is near.
