“Where is their God?”
Our God is in the heavens;
He does whatever he pleases.

Their idols are silver and gold,
The work of human hands.
A mouth they have, but they cannot speak;
Eyes, but they cannot see;
Ears they have, but they cannot hear;
A nose, but they cannot smell;
Hands they have, but they cannot feel;
Feet, but they cannot walk;
They make no sound with their throat.

“Where is their God?”
Our God is in the heavens;
He does whatever he pleases.

“Where is their God?”
Our God is in the heavens;
He does whatever he pleases.

The people who make them 
will become just like them,

Their idols are silver and gold,
The work of human hands.
A mouth they have, but they cannot speak;
Eyes, but they cannot see;
Ears they have, but they cannot hear;
A nose, but they cannot smell;
Hands they have, but they cannot feel;
Feet, but they cannot walk;
They make no sound with their throat.

“Where is their God?”
Our God is in the heavens;
He does whatever he pleases.
