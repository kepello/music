_Endurance To The End_

Matthew 10:22 says:
“You will be hated by all people on account of my name, but the one who has endured to the end will be saved.”

As I reflected on this verse, the example of Jeremiah came to mind. When God called him, he felt inadequate and reluctant. Yet he accepted his assignment and carried it out, even as opposition and suffering increased. He was rejected, beaten, imprisoned, and later thrown into a deep well and left to die. At one point, he resolved to stop speaking God’s words altogether—but he could not. God’s message burned within him like a fire he could not contain.

What moves me about Jeremiah is how human he feels. He was overwhelmed, afraid, and at times exhausted by his calling, yet he endured. He was not appreciated or celebrated, but he remained faithful to the words he had been given to speak. His life shows that endurance is often quiet, costly, and unseen.

I relate to that struggle. I often feel inadequate and overwhelmed, and I wonder whether faithfulness is still possible in those moments. This song is my reflection on that question—whether enduring to the end is less about strength, and more about continuing on when stopping feels easier.
