Hated for the Name you bear,
Endure to the end—salvation’s there.

You called my name before I knew
What it would cost to follow You
I said my hands were much too small
My voice not strong enough at all

Still You put the truth into those hands
And told me, “Go and make a stand”
I spoke the words You gave to say
They turned their hearts and looked away

They may hate me for Your name
Let the world reject and blame
Give me strength to still proclaim
Every word just the same

They beat me down for what I said
Bound me where the darkness spread
I told myself I’d speak no more
But silence burned me to the core

They may hate me for Your name
Let the world reject and blame
Give me strength to still proclaim
Every word just the same

I tried to bury every word
Pretend the call was never heard
I was torn inside of me
A fire that would not let me be

They may hate me for Your name
Still I speak it just the same
I will carry every word
I was given to be heard

Hated for the sake of Your name
I endure to the end—the same
