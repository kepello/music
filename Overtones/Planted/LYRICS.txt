Blessed is the one who doesn’t wander
Toward wicked counsel, dry and thin
He won’t stand where sin takes root
He won’t sit where lies begin

But he leans with delight to the law of Jehovah
It waters his roots, slow and sure, day and night

Like a tree planted by the stream
Set in the ground by a careful hand
Laid where the waters were made to run
Bearing fruit, just as it was planned

When the sky goes hard and bare
And the ground forgets the rain
Its leaves stay full through the burning heat
No mark of loss, no sign of strain

Like a tree planted by the stream
Set in the ground by a careful hand
Laid where the waters were made to run
Bearing fruit, just as it was planned

And all that he sets his hands to bears
