# Overtones

I am deeply moved by the beauty and depth of God's Word. I find that when scripture is set to music, it settles more firmly in my mind and heart. Music has always moved me profoundly, and it has become a way for me to linger with passages I don't want to rush past.

Psalm 1 speaks of reading in an undertone — a quiet, continual meditation. These songs are my attempt to take that same meditation and give it voice. What begins inwardly becomes something spoken and sung — an overtone.
