## Mercy
*(Jonah 1,2)*

This song sits with a familiar story and looks beyond the summary. Jonah is often remembered for running, but his story is really about fear, responsibility, correction, and compassion. He was chosen, overwhelmed, wrong at times — and still heard.

The distance Jonah runs is not measured in miles so much as uncertainty and fear. Between panic and obedience, between judgment and prayer, his story reminds us that even sincere faith can falter, and that faltering does not mean being abandoned.

Mercy here is not approval or excuse. It does not rush, announce itself, or explain everything. It meets us where we fall, corrects us where we wander, and remains when fear makes obedience feel impossible.

This song is less about what Jonah did, and more about what God did — and continues to do — for imperfect people trying to obey under the weight of fear.
