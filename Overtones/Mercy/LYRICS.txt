The timbers cried, the canvas tore
A howling wind that he couldn't ignore
Men shouting prayers to gods of stone
While guilt sat heavy in Jonah's bones

He knew the cost, he knew the blame
Knew every wave was calling his name
He saw their fear, he heard their cries
And chose the sea before their eyes

A prophet called in a broken land
Faithful steps where few would stand
Kings did wrong, the message — hard
Still Jonah spoke what God had charged

But NIN-uh-vuh loomed, a city of blades
Streets soaked deep in violent ways
A message heavy on his tongue
A call that left his courage numb

So don’t be quick to call him weak
Or judge the fear he couldn’t beat
He fell, he learned, he rose again
That’s how God’s mercy reaches men

If you’ve ever run, if you’ve ever prayed
For the storm to break, for the fear to fade
Hold to this truth when hope is gone:
All things are possible
— with GOD

Cold black water, no way back
Seaweed pulling, light turned black
The ship pulled off, the night closed in
Silence deeper than the wind

Then in the deep, a living grave
A great fish took him from the waves
Yet even there, where hope had fled
His breath was held — not lost, not dead

Inside the dark, his cry, his prayer
Jehovah heard — always there

No depth too deep, no night too long
No place beyond where He is strong
He knows your fear, He hears your cry
He stays with you when hope runs dry

Three days waiting, mercy shown
The sea gave way — he was not alone
He doesn’t leave us where we fall
He will help us up — He can save us all

So don’t be quick to call him weak
Or judge the fear he couldn’t beat
He fell, he learned, he rose again
That’s how God’s mercy reaches men

If you’ve ever run, if you’ve ever prayed
For the storm to break, for the fear to fade
Hold to this truth when hope is gone:
All things are possible
— with GOD

He walked back up that broken road
Not proud — but changed, and not alone
If God could lift him from that sea
He can still do the same for me
