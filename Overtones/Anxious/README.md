# Anxious

_Stop Being Anxious_

This was one of the first songs I arranged.

The lyrics aren’t mine. They come directly from scripture, from Jesus’ simple and direct statement: “Stop being anxious.” That sentence matters to me because it doesn’t deny reality. It acknowledges it. It recognizes that anxiety is already present—that the listener is already carrying something heavy.

That has always been true for me.

I overthink. I internalize. Anxiety comes easily, and panic attacks have been part of my life. If that instruction stood alone, I wouldn’t know how to follow it. The ability to live with anxiety—to manage it, to reduce its grip—has come through good doctors, better medication, and the steady encouragement and reminders found in the Bible. Not one thing instead of another. All of it together.

This song centers on one of those reminders: the picture of a bird that doesn’t worry about what it will eat tomorrow. Not because life is easy, but because its care isn’t its own responsibility. And then the quiet, personal reminder that follows—that God cares for us… for me… far more than He does for the birds.

This song isn’t a cure and it isn’t a command shouted from a distance. It’s a gentle interruption—a reminder to pause, breathe, and loosen the grip just a little. Sometimes that’s enough for the moment.
