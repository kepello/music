_Ordinary Ways_

How can we not love Peter?  In the Gospels, he comes across as so unmistakably real—impetuous, outspoken, imperfect. And yet, we never doubt his love or his faith. He learned, sometimes the easy way, often the hard way. But he learned. And that is what makes him such a powerful example for us.

One moment that captures this so clearly is the account of Jesus washing the apostles’ feet. It reveals the masterful way Jesus taught—often through action.

In this song, I imagine that scene from Peter’s point of view. At first, he resists. Surely this work is beneath Jesus. Then, once corrected, Peter swings in the opposite direction—asking Jesus to wash him completely. In both responses, we see Peter learning in real time.

The lesson is one Peter would go on to live out: that greatness is not shown through prominence or position, but through service. And that service, practiced quietly and consistently, speaks more powerfully than the grandest display.

I want to imitate that example—and no doubt fail many times along the way. And that’s why I love Peter. He shows us that you can miss the lesson, stumble forward, and still keep trying until it finally takes root.
