He got up from the evening meal
Rose from the table low
Laid His coat aside
Where the lamplight barely glowed

He tied a towel around His waist
Like a servant passing through
Poured water in the basin there
And did what none would do

We’d been talking under our breath
Who was strong, who would lead
Watching hands stay clean and still
While pride refused to kneel

No one reached for the washing bowl
No one claimed that place
Then He crossed the room in silence
And stopped in front of my face

Lord, you’ll never wash my feet.
He said -- If I don’t wash you,
you have no part with Me.

Lord—then ALL  of me
Don’t stop what You’ve begun
My hands, my head, wash everything
If that’s how this is done

He took His place and said, “You see
Why I came down low?
You call Me Teacher —and you are right
So do what I just showed.”

You showed me love doesn’t look like thrones
Or who the room obeys
It looks like bending down to serve
In ordinary ways

If You would wash another’s feet
Knowing what we’d do
Then teach my hands the humble work
You’ve shown them how to do

Open eyes and willing hands
The work that goes unseen
Serving is shown in lowered ways
In places in between

You showed me love doesn’t look like thrones
Or who the room obeys
It looks like bending down to serve
In ordinary ways

If You would wash another’s feet
Knowing what we’d do
Then teach my hands the humble work
You’ve shown them how to do

The basin’s still there
The towel still worn
The work You showed me
Still goes on

You showed me love doesn’t look like thrones
Or who the room obeys
It looks like bending down to serve
In ordinary ways
