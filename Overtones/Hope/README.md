*There Is Hope Even For A Tree*

My song “There Is Hope Even for a Tree” is based on Job chapter 14.

Job reveals himself as a man of profound faith. He was battered by suffering without knowing its source, deeply wounded to the point where death felt like relief. Those feelings can resonate with us at times as well.

What stands out most is not his pain, but his faith. Without most of the Bible yet written, without examples of resurrection, without the teachings of Jesus, Job was still convinced that his God would not forget him. He believed God had set a limit to death—and that life could return again. That confidence brings great comfort to us, reminding us that such faith is possible.

One verse in this chapter struck me in a new way during a recent reading—something I had previously overlooked. Job’s simple comparison to a tree:

“For there is hope even for a tree.
If it is cut down, it will sprout again.”

Such a quiet image, and yet so powerful. Life returning where it seemed finished. Hope surviving even after loss.

That single illustration became the heart of this song.
