For there is hope even for a tree.
If it is cut down, it will sprout again,
And its twigs will continue to grow.

If its root grows old in the ground
And its stump dies in the soil,
At the scent of water it will sprout;
And it will produce branches like a new plant.

For there is hope even for a tree.
If it is cut down, it will sprout again,
And its twigs will continue to grow.

But a man dies and lies powerless;
When a human expires, where is he?
Waters disappear from the sea,
And a river drains away and dries up.

For there is hope even for a tree.
If it is cut down, it will sprout again,
And its twigs will continue to grow.

Man also lies down and does not get up.
Until heaven is no more, they will not wake up,
Nor will they be aroused from their sleep.

For there is hope even for a tree.
If it is cut down, it will sprout again,
And its twigs will continue to grow.

O that in the Grave you would conceal me,
That you would hide me until your anger passes by,
That you would set a time limit for me and remember me!

For there is hope even for a tree.
If it is cut down, it will sprout again,
And its twigs will continue to grow.

That you would set a time limit for me and remember me!
