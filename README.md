For much of my life, I've leaned heavily into mental and logical thinking—engineering, structure, and problem-solving. Over time, I realized that this came at the expense of something equally important: emotional expression.

Music has always moved me, yet I only recently learned that this could be engaged with, not just felt.
The music I write now is an attempt to approach sound and song from a different direction: not analysis, polish, or achievement,
but expression. To feel, to experiment, and to allow emotional release without needing to justify it.

These are best thought of as personal collections—songs I’ve created primarily for myself, grouped by their tone, origin, and purpose rather than by style or polish.

The collections are Dedicated (songs for or about friends), Deeply (emotional songs written for my own processing), Digressions (light-hearted, curious, or playful detours), and Overtones (songs rooted in scripture and reflection). Together, they form a kind of musical journal—honest, unfinished, and allowed to be exactly what it is.

These songs were created for personal reasons, but you’re welcome to listen—and if you find any value in them, I hope you enjoy them.
