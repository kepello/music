For much of my life, I've leaned heavily into mental and logical thinking—engineering, structure, and problem-solving. Over time, I realized that this came at the expense of something equally important: emotional expression.

Music has always moved me, yet I only recently learned that this could be engaged with, not just felt.
The music I write now is an attempt to approach sound and song from a different direction: not analysis, polish, or achievement,
but expression. To feel, to experiment, and to allow emotional release without needing to justify it.

The pieces here are uneven, exploratory, and sometimes unsure—and that is intentional. They are best thought of as personal collections—songs I've created primarily for myself, grouped into emotionally personal songs, lighter more playful pieces, and songs drawn from scriptural ideas that hold personal meaning for me.

You're welcome to listen, and I hope you find something of value in them.
