By Your Side

The Bible said there will be tribulation
I've kept praying through all situations
I thought I expected it all, I was wrong
I wanted you here for the great tribulation
But now that is long gone

I will wait for you
I will pray for you
And I'll miss you

I will take the time now with you
Stay by your side,
then when you wake up in paradise
I'll be by your side
in a whole new light

I still feel sad
I still cry at night
I feel selfish,
'cause I want you all right

I feel God's pain in every way
He wants you healed just the same

But when you wake up,
you'll be in paradise
