_By Your Side_

This song was written for someone deeply loved.

A friend shared it with me. I consider that a gift—not because it was written for me, but because she trusted me with something very personal. She had written the song for her grandmother, sang it herself, and accompanied it on ukulele. The heart, the story, and the meaning all belong to her and to that relationship.

Hearing it stayed with me.

The lyrics hold a rare honesty—faith mixed with sorrow, longing held alongside hope. They don’t rush past grief or try to soften it, but they also don’t let go of the promise underneath it all.

I wanted to arrange some music for these words not to reinterpret them, and certainly not to compete with the original. Nothing could compare to her singing this herself. Instead, this arrangement is simply an acknowledgment—of how deeply her openness and trust affected me, and how love, once shared, can ripple outward in quiet and meaningful ways.
