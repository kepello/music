Because He Hears My Voice

[Intro]

[Pre-chorus]
Because he hears my voice

[Chorus]
I love Jehovah
Because he hears my voice, my pleas for help

[Verse]
For he inclines his ear to me,
And I will call on him as long as I live.
[Verse]
The ropes of death encircled me;
The Grave had me in its grip.
 
[Chorus]
I love Jehovah
Because he hears my voice, my pleas for help

[Verse]
I was overcome by distress and grief.
 But I called on the name of Jehovah:
“O Jehovah, rescue me!”

[Verse]
Jehovah is compassionate and righteous;
Our God is merciful.

[Chorus]
I love Jehovah
Because he hears my voice, my pleas for help

[Verse]
Jehovah is guarding the inexperienced.
I was brought low, and he saved me.

[Chorus]
I love Jehovah
Because he hears my voice, my pleas for help

[Breakdown]
Because he hears my voice

[Outro]
Let my soul rest once again,
For Jehovah has dealt kindly with me.
