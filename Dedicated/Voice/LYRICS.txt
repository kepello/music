Because He Hears My Voice

Because he hears my voice

I love Jehovah
Because he hears my voice, my pleas for help

For he inclines his ear to me,
And I will call on him as long as I live.

The ropes of death encircled me;
The Grave had me in its grip.
 
I love Jehovah
Because he hears my voice, my pleas for help

I was overcome by distress and grief.
 But I called on the name of Jehovah:
"O Jehovah, rescue me!"

Jehovah is compassionate and righteous;
Our God is merciful.

I love Jehovah
Because he hears my voice, my pleas for help

Jehovah is guarding the inexperienced.
I was brought low, and he saved me.

I love Jehovah
Because he hears my voice, my pleas for help

Because he hears my voice

Let my soul rest once again,
For Jehovah has dealt kindly with me.
