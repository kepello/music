_Because He Hears My Voice_

This song was created as a gift for a friend.

My own musical instincts tend to lean toward blues, rock, country-rock, and acoustic folk. When I asked her what she enjoyed listening to, she told me—very kindly—that rock was her least favorite. Instead, she shared her love for smoother styles: jazz textures, gentle rhythms, expressive melody, and music that leaves room to breathe. She also shared a verse that’s especially meaningful to her—Psalm 116:1.

So this song was written with her ears and her heart in mind.

It was a treat stepping outside my usual habits and shaping something around her taste and the the verse she loves. While it may not be my natural style, that’s part of what made it special. This wasn’t about writing for myself—it was about listening, adapting, and offering something personal in response.

Sometimes the best gifts aren’t the ones that sound most like us,
but the ones that sound like care.
