### Buddy

*Buddy and Sid*

Some songs are written as memories. Others are written as thank-yous.
This one is both.

“Buddy and Sid” was written for a traveling overseer and his wife who served our circuit for a season—three short years that passed far too quickly. Their role takes them from place to place, strengthening congregations and then moving on, often without much fanfare. That’s the nature of the work, and it’s something I’ve always respected.

During a particularly difficult period in my own life, Buddy took a genuine, personal interest in me. His kindness, encouragement, and steady support meant more than he probably realized at the time. He wasn’t just doing an assignment—he was being a friend. And that made all the difference.

This song is a simple expression of gratitude: for the roads they traveled, for the faith they helped strengthen, and for the care they showed along the way. Though they’ve moved on now to a new assignment, their kindness and service continue to bear fruit.

Some friends are only with us for a chapter.
Sometimes that chapter changes everything.

This song is light-hearted, because they lightened my heavy heart.
