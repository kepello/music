Buddy and Sid

Buddy and Syd on the open road
Traveling light with a precious load
Every place feels new somehow
Same good work, the same vow
No fame to claim, no praise to chase
Just faithful steps in Jehovah’s ways


Sent to strengthen, then move along
Helping hearts grow firm and strong
With words that care and truth you share
You come to see how we all fare

Thank you for the roads you go
For every seed of faith you sow
For courage given, hope that grows
In every heart your kindness knows
Three short years, then change of scene
New assignment, same routine
Buddy and Syd, we want you to know
We’re deeply thankful for what you sow


Long before us, the pattern stood
Servants who traveled as shepherds should
Paul and Barnabas, place to place
Teaching truth and building faith
Coming back just to see
How strong the brothers came to be

[Pre-Chorus 2]
That same concern, that same care
Still sends you onward everywhere
Not settling down, yet leaving strong
Helping faith where it belongs

Thank you for the roads you go
For every seed of faith you sow
For courage given, hope that grows
In every heart your kindness knows
Three short years, then change of scene
New assignment, same routine
Buddy and Syd, we want you to know
We’re deeply thankful for what you sow


Pack it up, then pack again
New halls, new doors, familiar friends
You plant, you water, trust the rest
Leaving Jehovah to do the best

Thank you for the life you give
For showing how true love lives
Not for a name, not for applause
But faithful service to the cause
Wherever you’re sent, wherever you go
This gratitude goes with you both
Buddy and Syd, please always know
Your work bears fruit more than you know


Wherever you’re sent, wherever you go
This gratitude goes with you both
Buddy and Syd, please always know
Your work bears fruit more than you know
