### Dedicated

Some of these songs were written for friends.
Others were inspired by them.

Shared troubles are easier to bear. As Francis Bacon wrote, for those without true friends, “the world is but a wilderness.” Having real friends—and striving to be a good one in return—can make life more bearable. It can also make it deeply beautiful.

These songs come from that place.
From friendships that steady us in hard moments, celebrate with us in joyful ones, and remind us that we do not walk alone.
