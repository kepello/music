I was old enough to feel the danger
I knew the source, I knew the signs
Words hit hard, but worse was waiting
Living always on the line

You fought to find your voice
You told him it was time to go
The house stood bare, the rooms were empty
And emptiness felt safe, even so

You showed me without meaning 
How conviction doesn’t bend
That doing what you believe is right
Can still cost everything

I wasn’t searching for a feeling
I was trying to see it clear
I read the words the way they stood
And stayed with them right here

I didn't start out to cross a boundary
But I knew what it would cost
Once I knew where I was standing
I knew what might be lost

I don’t need closure to remember
Or forgiveness to be free
We loved each other in the space between
What we were and couldn’t be

If love’s a debt we never settle
I still carry mine with me
Some truths don’t end in answers
They just keep company

You put my life in a cardboard box
Anger and resolve side by side
Everything was loud and breaking
And neither of us knew how to survive

I was too young to hold what you were saying
You were the one who had the final say
I wasn’t trying to walk away from you
I knew that I could no longer stay

You showed me without meaning 
How conviction doesn’t bend
That doing what you believe is right
Can still cost everything

Years went by without a word between us
Just a space I learned to stay
Then I brought her name into the quiet
And you didn’t turn away

We met on neutral ground, a borrowed table
Nothing asked for, nothing owed
You let her break the silence
And something quietly let go

I don’t need closure to remember
Or forgiveness to be free
We loved each other in the space between
What we were and couldn’t be

If love’s a debt we never settle
I still carry mine with me
Some truths don’t end in answers
They just keep company

I tried to get to you through closed doors
Through rules I couldn’t bend
I said your name to silent hallways
Hoping you’d hear it somewhere there

I came when they said “now or never”
You were already gone inside
I sat and held the space between us
And said goodbye without your eyes

If love’s a debt we never settle
I still carry mine with me
Some truths don’t end in answers
They just keep company

I learned how to keep walking
With unfinished things inside
If that was something you showed me
I’m still learning how to say goodbye
