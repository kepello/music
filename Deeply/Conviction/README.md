### Conviction

This song was written about my relationship with my mother—a relationship that shaped me deeply and unevenly, in ways both strong and painful.

When I was very young, she did something that left a lasting impression on me: she removed my alcoholic father from our home and chose a harder path rather than a quieter one. As a single mother, she carried responsibilities few could see and fewer would choose. She continued making payments on our home even after the bank had written off the loan, insisting on honoring the debt—not because she was required to, but because she wanted her sons to understand what integrity looks like when no one is watching. Those early years impressed me more than I understood at the time.

Later, when my life took a spiritual direction different from hers, that strength turned into division. She was deeply upset and it divided us.  She handed me a box of my baby pictures and told me I was no longer her son. We didn’t speak for years. When that break came, it wasn’t only words. There was no shouting, no long explanation—just a quiet finality that made the separation unmistakable.

Years later, when I told her I was engaged, she agreed to meet us at a restaurant—a kind of neutral ground—to meet Debra. She soon loved Debra, and from that moment, we began again. We never revisited the lost years. There was no apology, no accounting—only a quiet restart, as if the silence had never happened.

During COVID, illness carried her from hospital to rehabilitation and then to a nursing home. We weren’t allowed to visit. When the call finally came saying we could—and should—come right away, we drove straight there. She was unconscious when we arrived and lived only a few hours after.

Her passing unsettled me in ways I didn’t expect. This song became a place to hold the complicated truth—that a relationship can be both loving and damaging, formative and unfinished. Writing it didn’t solve everything, but it helped give shape to feelings that had lived without words for a long time.

Sometimes healing doesn’t come from answers,
but from simply naming what was always there.
