[Verse 1]
Seventeen years of time we trace
Soft white curls, her adorable face
Scratch her back, she’d dance and spin
Little hops that made us grin

[Verse 2]
She had her say, her own small tone
A little bark to claim her own
Stubborn joy on tiny feet
A little stinker, firm and sweet

[Verse 3]
From the passenger side, the miles rolled slow
She slept with me while Debra drove
When Debra had her harder days, she’d stay
Curled in close, she’d lay that way

[Bridge]
You don’t measure a life by years
You count the smiles, you count the tears
Those seventeen years aren’t lost today
She just taught us to love this way

[Verse 4]
The hardest mercy we ever gave
Was letting love be more than stay
Held her close, said thank you then
For every mile, every when

[Outro]
If love could linger, she’d still be here
In quiet ways we still hold near
Every room still knows her name
Our days will never be the same
