Seventeen years of time we trace
Soft white curls, her adorable face
Scratch her back, she’d dance and spin
Little hops that made us grin

She had her say, her own small tone
A little bark to claim her own
Stubborn joy on tiny feet
A little stinker, firm and sweet

From the passenger side, the miles rolled slow
She slept with me while Debra drove
When Debra had her harder days, she’d stay
Curled in close, she’d lay that way

You don’t measure a life by years
You count the smiles, you count the tears
Those seventeen years aren’t lost today
She just taught us to love this way

The hardest mercy we ever gave
Was letting love be more than stay
Held her close, said thank you then
For every mile, every when

If love could linger, she’d still be here
In quiet ways we still hold near
Every room still knows her name
Our days will never be the same
