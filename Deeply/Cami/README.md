This song was written in one of the hardest moments we’ve faced—saying goodbye to our dog, Cami.

She was with us for seventeen years, woven into the daily fabric of our lives in ways that are hard to explain unless you’ve loved a dog that long. She was especially precious to my wife, Debra, steady and close through every season. As age and illness took their toll, we reached a moment where love had to speak louder than the desire to hold on. It was the right decision. And it hurt deeply.

These lyrics aren’t about loss alone—they’re about a life fully shared. The small habits, the stubborn joy, the miles traveled together, and the quiet comfort she gave without ever needing words. Cami didn’t just live with us; she shaped the rhythm of our days and the way our home felt.

Letting her go was an act of mercy, but it didn’t feel merciful in the moment. Writing this song became a way to say thank you—for the years, for the companionship, and for the way she taught us how deeply love can settle into ordinary life.

Some love never really leaves.
It simply changes the shape of the room.
