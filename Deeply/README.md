This music wasn't planned.

I didn't expect songwriting to become a coping mechanism, or for it to arrive as suddenly and deeply as it did. But the timing, as painful as it is, feels strangely fortunate. We've just said goodbye to a dear pet—a family member and a special friend to my wife, Debra—and these songs have become a place where grief and gratitude can exist at the same time.

I've always processed things slowly and inwardly. Writing lyrics and music has opened a new path—one that's raw, imperfect, and honest. The songs here aren't polished, and they may not carry meaning for anyone else. They weren't written for an audience. They were written because they needed to be.

This hurt to write yet brought unexpected relief. It marks a moment of learning how to let feelings out instead of holding them quietly inside. This is simply that: a record of emotions finding a voice, and music doing what I didn't know it could do—help me heal.
